## About
*what's this?*
---
This is [darplants' website](www.darhh.com/) created by myself, [darhh](https://github.com/darHH)! I decided to built a website for my small plant business on Instagram. It was a great experience learning new frameworks, problem-solving, and designing and styling the website! 

## Languages
*Languages I used*
---
1. Typescript 
2. Javascript (just a hint of)

## Frameworks
*Frameworks I learnt and used*
---
1. Next.js
2. TailwindCSS
3. React

## APIs
*APIs I used*
---
1. Instagram's graph API 
> Acted as my ‘database,’ where I fetch my plants. Since I was already operating on Instagram and planned to continue doing so, it streamlined the process of releasing plants, as I only had to upload to Instagram.
2. (attempted) genai and gemini API
> Tried to automate plant care guides and descriptions by querying GenAI/Gemini. It worked, but I removed it as both models required payment to continue, and it didn’t make sense to pay for queries each time the page loaded.

## Useful links 
*Useful resourced I used that helped the development process*
---
1. [coolers.co](https://coolors.co/) 
> Helped me find matching/contrasting colors for the website, keep track of my color palette, and shades of a particular color.
2. [fontpair.co](https://www.fontpair.co/)
> Helped me find nice fonts that suit the theme of the website.
3. [tailwindcss documentation](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/)
> To learn styling with tailwindcss as it was new to me.
4. [html and css documentation](https://devdocs.io/html/)
> To refer to some HTML syntax.
5. [react documentation](https://react.dev/)
> To recap React syntax, used the least.


## Programs 
*Programs that I used*
1. Git and Github 
> Of course...
2. Sourcetree
> To help manage git better (commits, pushes, etc)
3. Cloudfare
> For domain name and security when hosting website.
4. Vercel 
> Next.js' free hosting service (thank you!).

## Others 
Overall, I learned a lot and have future plans to continue learning and building new things for the website. Stay tuned!
